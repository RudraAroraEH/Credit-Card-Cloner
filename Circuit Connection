RFID RC522   to   Arduino UNO
---------------------------
SDA (SS) →   Pin 10
SCK →   Pin 13
MOSI →   Pin 11
MISO →   Pin 12
GND  →   GND
RST   →   Pin 9
3.3V  →   3.3V

Please note that the connections may vary depending on the specific Arduino board and RFID module used. Make sure to follow the pinout of the board and the module when connecting the components.
