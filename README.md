# Credit-Card-Cloner
# RFID Cloner/Credit Card Cloning Project

This project would develop an RFID cloner and a credit card cloning tool. The tool can be used for penetration testing and security research. The tool emulates an RFID/NFC tag as well as a credit card to let the attacker enter a system without authorization by bypassing security measures in place.

## Features
 Emulate RFID tags and NFC chips
 Clone credit cards with read/write data ability
- Supports various types of RFID/NFC tags, such as MIFARE, ISO 14443, etc.
- Read and write to cloned cards
- Command-line interface for easy user usage
- Cross-platform compatibility with Windows, Linux, macOS

## Requirements
- C programming language
- Arduino Genuino
- Components: Arduino UNO R3, RFID RC522, Jumper Wires, Breadboard
- Required C libraries: Easymfrc522
- Hardware for RFID/NFC reader/writer, such as Arduino or RFID RC522
- RFID/NFC tags and cards for cloning
